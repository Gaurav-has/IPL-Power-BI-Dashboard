IPL Performance Analysis Dashboard

The core objective was to transform raw IPL match data into a single, interactive analytical solution that provides strategic insights on team success factors, 
player contributions, and critical match decisions (like the coin toss).

#Key Dashboard Insights

Strategic Decision Analysis: Identified and quantified critical trends, such as the dominant 71.6% tendency to field first after winning the toss, providing immediate strategic context.

KPI Tracking: Implemented clear Card Visuals for instant status monitoring of Total Matches, Team Winners, and Team Losses.

Venue Performance: Conducted Geospatial Analysis by breaking down venue statistics to understand pitching conditions and setting ideal targets.

Talent Evaluation: Visualized top individual performers based on "Player of the Match" selections.

Interactivity: Designed the dashboard with Slicers for dynamic filtering across all visuals.
